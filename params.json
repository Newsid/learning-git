{"name":"Representation of Skeletal Chest","body":"### Introduction\r\nIn this project, I will represent all the Skeletal System of the Thorax.\r\nThe Skeletal System of the Thorax is composed by the thoracic vertebrae (12 vertebrae), the ribcage (12 couple of ribs), the sternum and the manubrium.\r\n\r\n**Note:**\r\nBeing this a specular design, for each object was designed only the left side, and then copied using the S Transfrorm with parameter \"-1\"\r\n\r\n**Note 2:**\r\nIn the beginning I tried using solids, but given the excessive load time, I opted for using surfaces.\r\n\r\n**Note 3:**\r\nSince I had no real measures, all proportions were calculated by eye.\r\n\r\n### Main Structure of a Vertebra\r\n![Structure of a Vertebra](http://img189.imageshack.us/img189/300/strutturavertebra.png)\r\n\r\nTo create the main structure of a vertebra, I created two bases (upper and lower) and I joined via BEZIER(S1), using intermediate curves for the recess.\r\n\r\n### Back of a Vertebra\r\n![Back of a Vertebra](http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/2252/retrovertebra.png)\r\n\r\nTo create the back structure of a Vertebra, I created a series of NUBS starting from the center.\r\nThe NUBS represent the contours of the structure and were combined by using BEZIER(S1).\r\nEnds were created separately using BEZIER.\r\n\r\n### A Vertebra\r\nNow we can see the entire vertebra, following the combination of the main structure and the back structure.\r\n\r\n![Vertebra](http://img844.imageshack.us/img844/3155/vertebra.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Ribs\r\nFor each Rib I used series of NUBS joined by BEZIER, starting from the same point of the corresponding vertebra.\r\nEach rib has obviously a different curvature and end point.\r\n\r\nIn this image We can see the 10° vertebra and the 10° left and right ribs.\r\n\r\n![Vertebra and Ribs](http://img802.imageshack.us/img802/6526/vertebracostole.png)\r\n\r\n### Sternum and Manubrium\r\nSternum and Manubrium are the two bones on the front of the chest.\r\n\r\nI used these bones as a reference for the curvature of the ribs, lacking the real measurements and proportions.\r\n\r\nAs for the previous, I used series of NUBS for the curves and BEZIER to generate the surface.\r\n\r\n![Sternum and Manubrium](http://img705.imageshack.us/img705/2357/sternomanubrio.png)\r\n\r\n### Thorax\r\nHere we see the final design, obtained by the union of all individual objects.\r\n\r\n![Thorax (complete project)](http://img713.imageshack.us/img713/300/torace.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Reference Material\r\n**3d reproduction of the human body:** https://www.biodigitalhuman.com/\r\n![Bio Digital Human](http://img703.imageshack.us/img703/2787/biodigitalhuman.png)\r\n\r\n**3d reproduction of the human body:** http://www.zygotebody.com/\r\n![Zygote Body](http://img513.imageshack.us/img513/9887/zygotebody.png)","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
